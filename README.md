# COMP8610_Project
Project for COMP8610 Deep Learning

## Steps to run the Project
**Conda Recommended**

## Follow this
1. ```bash
   pip -r install requirements.txt

2. ```bash
    python run.py --data ./datasets --dataset-name cifar10 --log-every-n-steps 100 --epochs 100
## Notes

- Noted Issues, STL-10 Dataset produces a Windows Error
related to pickling seeking to resolve
- Cifar-10 works and is trainable seek to
train on GPU to reduce training time
